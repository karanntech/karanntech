### Hey, I'm Karann 👋🏽  

Like Osamu Dazai from Bungou Stray Dogs, I blend a bit of mystery with a passion for backend development. At 21 years old and based in India, I channel my fascination for anime and technology into creating elegant and efficient backend systems. When I’m not immersed in code, you might catch me contemplating life’s complexities or indulging in the latest anime series.
