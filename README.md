# Hi there! <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d04509037f646eab5c2d6d130574ef059fa8eef92e45a139a827a8d06e9d5042/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966" width="40" />
I’m [Karan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karannkumar), a web developer from India who loves building clean and interactive web apps.

I enjoy turning ideas into responsive, smooth user interfaces using React, TypeScript, and cool animation libraries. During my internship, I worked on real-world tools like an AI-based resume parser and a candidate discovery system — both live and in use today.

Outside of coding, I’m usually sketching designs in Figma, watching anime, or exploring something new in frontend tech.
